# OOP-with-C-
Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a key paradigm of the C# language and is extensively used in the ASP.NET Core web-framework, so it is a critical skill for us to learn. The main focal point of OOP in C# is class creation. Classes define what objects we can build, how we can interact with them, and how they themselves interact with our program.
